# RabbitMQ Exchange Types Demo

This repository contains implementations of various RabbitMQ exchange types, demonstrating different message routing patterns. The project includes both C# and Node.js implementations for different exchange types.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### C# Implementations
- Located in the `c-sharp` directory
- Contains implementations of different RabbitMQ exchange types in C#

### Node.js Implementations
- Located in the `nodejs` directory
- Contains implementations of different RabbitMQ exchange types in Node.js

## Exchange Types Demonstrated

The project demonstrates several RabbitMQ exchange types:

1. **Direct Exchange**
   - Routes messages to queues based on exact matching of the routing key

2. **Fanout Exchange**
   - Broadcasts messages to all bound queues regardless of the routing key

3. **Topic Exchange**
   - Routes messages based on pattern matching of the routing key

4. **Headers Exchange**
   - Routes messages based on message headers rather than routing keys

5. **Dead Letter Exchange**
   - Routes messages to a dead letter queue when they cannot be delivered to the intended queue

6. **Alternate Exchange**
   - Routes messages to an alternate exchange when they cannot be delivered to the intended exchange

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Cloud RabbitMQ server
- Node.js (for Node.js implementations)
- .NET SDK (for C# implementations)

### Running the Examples
Each exchange type implementation contains both producer and consumer components. The specific setup and running instructions can be found in each implementation directory.

## Implementation Details

### Node.js Implementation
- Uses the `amqplib` package for RabbitMQ communication
- Each exchange type has its own producer and consumer implementation
- Configuration is handled through environment variables

### C# Implementation
- Uses the RabbitMQ .NET client library
- Implements different exchange types with proper error handling
- Includes examples of message publishing and consuming
